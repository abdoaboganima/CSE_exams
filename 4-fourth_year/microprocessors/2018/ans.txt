Don't trust these solutions :P

Q1)
The stack is a block of memory that may be used for temporarily storing the contents of registers inside
the CPU.
If the contents of register SS=3500h and the content of the register SP=FFFEh.

a. Calculate the physical address: PA=35000h+FFFEH=44FFEh
b. Calculate the lower range of the stack: 35000h+0000h=35000h
c. Calculate the upper range of the stack segment: 35000+FFFF = 44FFF
d. Show the logical address of the stack: 3500:FFFE


Q2)
AL=64
SI=11
CX=0


Q3)
b)
4A3C:332AH     =   4D6EAH
